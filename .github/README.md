## Project Summary
==================

Website: Comox Valley Farmer's Market
URL: https://cvfm.ca/  

### Most important purpose of site

The current site states their markets' purpose as the following:

- To promote the economic health of the local farm community
- To provide quality locally grown farm products
- To educate the community in agricultural issues
- To promote local agriculture

The most important purpose for the site itself is to inform Comox Valley residents of how they can contribute to and attend the available markets.

### Target audience

The target audiences include the following:

- Comox Valley residents who are interested in buying locally grown foods and listening to live music
- Comox Valley local farmers, fishers, bakers, processors, alcohol brewers/distillers, herbalists, and musicians who want to sell/perform directly to consumers

### Overall message

The overall message is to promote a family-friendly, inclusive market where communities can gather to purchase fresh, local foods while supporting the local and regional economy.

### Issues with current site

The main issues with the current site are its page layout and site architecture. It is difficult to navigate the menus and find information; for example, the application forms are difficult to find.

Other issues with the site include:

- Speed (pingdom website speed test has the load time at 5.85s)
- Accessibility (ex. the "apply here" page includes a table as an image instead of code)

## Look and Feel
=================

### Mood

The farmer’s market is meant to be an enjoyable, cheerful, and lively experience for visitors, but they also engage in community work such as sponsorships programs and food banks for low-income families. For this reason, the site should convey a fun, enthusiastic, yet professional feeling in both text and visual styles.

### Inspiration

### Colours

I’d like to keep the colour scheme the original site has. This is mostly monochrome for backgrounds and text, and green for navigation buttons, links, and images. I may try incorporating yellow or orange for highlight colours, as those are the colours I think of when I picture agriculture.

My chosen colours:

- Primary = green
- Neutral = black and white
- Highlight = yellow and/or orange

### Images

Most of the images from the original site are fine to use. I may need to compress the images. Depending on what colour palette I use, some of the images (such as the logo) may need to be updated to match.
