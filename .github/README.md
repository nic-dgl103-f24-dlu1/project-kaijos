# Project Website Plan Content

## Project Summary

Website: Comox Valley Farmer's Market
URL: https://cvfm.ca/  

### Most important purpose of site

The current site states their markets' purpose as the following:

- To promote the economic health of the local farm community
- To provide quality locally grown farm products
- To educate the community in agricultural issues
- To promote local agriculture

The most important purpose for the site itself is to inform Comox Valley residents of how they can contribute to and attend the available markets.

### Target audience

The target audiences include the following:

- Comox Valley residents who are interested in buying locally grown foods and listening to live music
- Comox Valley local farmers, fishers, bakers, processors, alcohol brewers/distillers, herbalists, and musicians who want to sell/perform directly to consumers

### Overall message

The overall message is to promote a family-friendly, inclusive market where communities can gather to purchase fresh, local foods while supporting the local and regional economy.

### Issues with current site

The main issues with the current site are its page layout and site architecture. It is difficult to navigate the menus and find information; for example, the application forms are difficult to find.

Other issues with the site include:

- Speed (pingdom website speed test has the load time at 5.85s)
- Accessibility (ex. the "apply here" page includes a table as an image instead of code)

## Look and Feel

### Mood

The markets are meant to be an enjoyable, cheerful, and lively experience for visitors, but they also engage in community work such as sponsorships programs and food banks for low-income families. For this reason, the site should convey a fun, enthusiastic, yet professional feeling in both text and visual styles.

### Inspiration

1. Digital Design and Development NIC - https://learndigital.dev/

I feel the DGL website has a professional mood, and the layout is similar to what I'm planning for my project.

2. Quest Reality Games Escape Rooms - https://questrealitygames.com/

! [Quest Reality Games Home Page](/Images/questrealitygames-homepage.png)

The Quest Reality Games website has a more fun, energetic mood. The colours are bright and joyful, and I like how they've organized and ordered the content blocks. The header navigation places a orange, square background around what ever page you're currently on, which I might like to copy for my site.

### Colours

I would like to keep the colour scheme the original site has. This is mostly monochrome for backgrounds and text, and green for navigation buttons, links, and images. I may try incorporating yellow or orange for highlight colours, as those are the colours I think of when I picture agriculture.

My chosen colours:

- Primary = green
- Neutral = black and white
- Highlight = yellow and/or orange

### Images

Most of the images from the original site are fine to use. I will need to compress the images. Depending on what colour palette I use, some of the images (such as the logo) may need to be updated to match.

### Fonts

The official logo uses the typeface Filson (guessed using https://www.myfonts.com/pages/whatthefont). Because Filson isn't available on Google Fonts, I'm instead using the following:

- Headlines: Lato
- Body Copy: Ubuntu
